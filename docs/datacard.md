# **Codebook & Pipeline Transformations – `data_final_FLORIDA`**

## **0. Pipeline Data Transformations**

The `datacard.md` documentation details how original survey measures flow dynamically through the function-oriented R scripts to populate statistical models. The structured transformations include:

- **Filtering:** Erroneous tracking flags (`ac1` & `ac2`) are parsed via `R/02_clean_data.R`.
- **Psychometric Missing Data & Scoring:** Handled within `R/03_transform_data.R`. Classical IRI responses are summarized by 80% completeness thresholds (`row_mean_with_floor`) providing aggregate scale derivations. `iri_total` and the IRI subscales are retained on their original response scale; no predictor z-score normalization is applied.
- **Data Matrix Reshaping:** Raw matrices maintain wide row configurations per participant. The `R/04_generate_variables.R` function shifts inputs logically grouping 10 repeated scenarios into vertical clusters (`judgements`), calculating outgroup derivations mapping participant alignment (Engineering/Humanities) independently to perpetrator and victim identity strings ensuring the integrity of hypotheses datasets (`judgments_accept_only.csv`).

## **1. Dataset Overview**

- The dataset includes:
  - **Sociodemographic variables**
  - **Attention checks**
  - **IRI empathy items renamed by subscale**
  - **Treatment order**
  - **Scenario-level experimental variables for 10 stages (`s1` to `s10`)**

---

## **2. Sociodemographic Variables**

- **Participant ID (`id`)**  
  Consecutive identifier assigned to each participant.

- **Commitment check (`commitment`)**  
  Initial question included to encourage more candid responses.

  **Coding**
  - `0` = I do not commit
  - `1` = Yes, I commit
  - `2` = I cannot promise it

- **Age (`age`)**  
  Age in completed years.

- **Socioeconomic status (`economic_status`)**  
  Socioeconomic stratum based on DANE categories.

  **Coding**
  - `0` = Rural
  - `1` = Stratum 1
  - `2` = Stratum 2
  - `3` = Stratum 3
  - `4` = Stratum 4
  - `5` = Stratum 5
  - `6` = Stratum 6

- **Sex assigned at birth (`sex`)**

  **Coding**
  - `0` = I prefer not to say
  - `1` = Woman
  - `2` = Man
  - `3` = Intersex

- **Participant faculty affiliation (`faculty_player`)**

  **Coding**
  - `1` = Humanities
  - `2` = Engineering

---

## **3. Attention Checks**

- **Attention check 1 (`ac1`)**

  **Coding**
  - `0` = Wrong
  - `1` = Right

- **Attention check 2 (`ac2`)**

  **Coding**
  - `0` = Wrong
  - `1` = Right

---

## **4. Psychological Variables (IRI)**

**Important note**

- Reverse-worded items were already recoded correctly before this final dataset was created.
- Items are scored from **0 to 4**.
- Higher values indicate **higher empathy**.

### **IRI Subscales**

- **FS** = Fantasy
- **EC** = Empathic Concern
- **PT** = Perspective Taking
- **PD** = Personal Distress

## **5. Treatment Variable**

- **Treatment order (`treatment`)**

Each participant evaluates **10 scenarios**:
- **5 as victim**
- **5 as observer**

To balance order effects, participants are randomly assigned to one of two sequences.

**Coding**
- `1` = Victim first, observer second (stages 1-5 = 2, stages 6-10 = 1)
- `2` = Observer first, victim second (stages 1-5 = 1, stages 6-10 = 2)
- `0` = Dropped from analytical dataset (used only for EDA purposes).

Using this treatment logic, 10 stage-specific variables (`role_s1` through `role_s10`) are programmatically populated to track the role the participant occupied in that specific scenario.

---

## **6. Scenario-Level Variables**

Each participant evaluates **10 stages (`s1` to `s10`)**.

In each stage, the variables are ordered as follows:

```text
role_sX
faculty_neg_1_sX
faculty_neg_2_sX
faculty_victim_sX
decision_neg1_sX
decision_neg2_sX
judgement_compare_sX
judgement_n1_sX
judgement_n2_sX
```

where **`sX` refers to `s1` through `s10`**.

---

### **6.1 Procedural Role**
Variables:
- `role_s1` to `role_s10`

**Coding**
- `1` = Observer
- `2` = Victim

---

## **7. Coding of Scenario-Level Variables**

### **7.1 Faculty of Negotiator 1**
Variables:
- `faculty_neg_1_s1` to `faculty_neg_1_s10`

### **7.2 Faculty of Negotiator 2**
Variables:
- `faculty_neg_2_s1` to `faculty_neg_2_s10`

**Coding for both negotiator faculty variables**
- `1` = Humanities
- `2` = Engineering
- `3` = Control (no faculty label shown)

---

### **7.3 Faculty of Victim**
Variables:
- `faculty_victim_s1` to `faculty_victim_s10`

**Coding**
- `1` = Humanities
- `2` = Engineering

---

### **7.4 Decision of Negotiator 1**
Variables:
- `decision_neg1_s1` to `decision_neg1_s10`

### **7.5 Decision of Negotiator 2**
Variables:
- `decision_neg2_s1` to `decision_neg2_s10`

**Coding for both decision variables**
- `0` = Reject
- `1` = Accept

---

### **7.6 Comparative Moral Judgment**
Variables:
- `judgement_compare_s1` to `judgement_compare_s10`

**Coding**
- `1` = Negotiator 1 acted worse
- `2` = Negotiator 2 acted worse
- `3` = Both acted equally

---

### **7.7 Numerical Moral Judgment for Negotiator 1**
Variables:
- `judgement_n1_s1` to `judgement_n1_s10`

### **7.8 Numerical Moral Judgment for Negotiator 2**
Variables:
- `judgement_n2_s1` to `judgement_n2_s10`

**Scale**
- `-9` = Acted very badly
- `0` = Neutral midpoint
- `9` = Acted very well

---

## **8. Dataset Structure**

- Each **row** = one participant
- Each participant evaluates **10 scenarios**
- Each scenario includes **2 negotiators**
- Therefore, each participant provides:
  - **10 comparative judgments**
  - **10 ratings for Negotiator 1**
  - **10 ratings for Negotiator 2**

This means the dataset is currently in **wide format**, with repeated scenario-level variables stored across columns.
